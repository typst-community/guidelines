## Contributing
All contributions are welcome, though, depending on the scope/impact of a change you may need to go though some channels first to avoid wasting your time on work that won't be merged.

- If you wish to fix grammatical errors feel free to open a PR directly, no issue or discussion is required here.
- In case you wish to improve the layout or appearance of the document, please include screenshots that make a compelling case for the change.
- If you want to document the conventions or best practices, you can open an issue or a discussion to make sure it is widely used enough to be considered convention/best practice.
  - Typically, if a lot of packages start using some sort of design pattern, adding it as a best practice is OK.
  - The same applies for removing conventions or best practices from the guidelines that no one uses anymore or which aren't relevant anymore (such as for things removed from Typst itself).
- To propose a standard, consider first discussing it on the [Community Discord Server][discord]. After that you can open an [RFC] to get community wide input and ensure it will be adopted by prominent tools and packages.
